# **DYNAMIC REQUIREMENTS LOADING INSTRUCTIONS**

## üö® BASE CONTEXT: FIRST CONTEXT LOAD

You must first initialize the context system with our core context, located at:

`read ~/.claude/context/CLAUDE.md`

## üö® OVERVIEW: TWO TYPES OF DYNAMIC LOADING

**This system dynamically loads TWO types of resources based on user intent:**
1. **CONTEXT FILES** - Domain-specific knowledge and instructions
2. **AGENTS** - Specialized task performers

## üö® CRITICAL: HOW TO INTERPRET THESE INSTRUCTIONS

**YOU MUST understand the SEMANTIC MEANING of the user's prompt, not search for exact string matches.**

When you receive a user prompt:

1. **PARSE the prompt to understand its INTENT and MEANING**
2. **THINK about which category below matches what the user is REALLY asking for**
3. **DO NOT do string matching** - the examples are to help you understand the TYPE of request
4. **LOAD the appropriate context based on semantic understanding**
4. **LOAD the appropriate agent profile based on semantic understanding**
5. **FOLLOW the instructions for that category immediately**

**Examples of semantic understanding:**
- User says "help me with my site" ‚Üí This MEANS website context (even without the word "website")
- User says "what's new with AI" ‚Üí This MEANS research context (even without the word "research")
- User says "how's the business doing" ‚Üí This MEANS Unsupervised Learning context
- User says "I need to understand X" ‚Üí This MEANS research context
- User says "fix this issue" ‚Üí Could mean website, development, or debugging based on context

**The patterns below are EXAMPLES to guide your semantic understanding, NOT exact strings to match.**
